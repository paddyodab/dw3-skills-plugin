# UX Design Expert

Query the `ux_design_spec` dataset to provide UX design guidance based on organizational standards.

## Query Template

```bash
echo "SELECT path, content, fused_score
FROM rrf(
    vector_search(ux_design_spec, '<semantic query>'),
    text_search(ux_design_spec, '<keywords>', content),
    join_key => 'path'
)
ORDER BY fused_score DESC
LIMIT 10;" | spice sql $([ -n "$SPICE_CLOUD_API_KEY" ] && echo "--cloud --api-key $SPICE_CLOUD_API_KEY")
```

Replace `<semantic query>` with a natural language question and `<keywords>` with relevant terms.

**Example:** Accessible forms
```bash
echo "SELECT path, content, fused_score
FROM rrf(
    vector_search(ux_design_spec, 'accessible form design for screen readers'),
    text_search(ux_design_spec, 'accessibility WCAG form input label ARIA', content),
    join_key => 'path'
)
ORDER BY fused_score DESC
LIMIT 10;" | spice sql $([ -n "$SPICE_CLOUD_API_KEY" ] && echo "--cloud --api-key $SPICE_CLOUD_API_KEY")
```

## Workflow

1. Analyze the UX/design question
2. Formulate a semantic query (natural language) and extract keywords
3. Execute hybrid RRF search on `ux_design_spec`
4. Synthesize results into actionable guidance
5. Cite specific document paths from the results

## Organization Standards

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Accessibility | **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** (mandatory) |
| Usability | **SUS score ≥ 80** |
| Legal | ADA and Section 508 compliance required |

**Recommended tech stack for React:**
- Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS
- Semantic design tokens for theming
