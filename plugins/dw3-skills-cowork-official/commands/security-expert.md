description: Provide security and compliance guidance for HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC2
---

Load the security-expert skill and provide guidance on the user's security or compliance question.

Query the `security_spec` dataset using the `spice_sql` tool with hybrid RRF search. Apply the appropriate compliance framework context (HIPAA for PHI, HITRUST for security controls, SOC2 for system security).

Cite specific document paths from the search results. If the query returns no results, provide general security guidance aligned with HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC2 requirements.
