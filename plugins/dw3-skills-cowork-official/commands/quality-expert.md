description: Provide QA and testing strategy guidance
---

Load the quality-expert skill and provide guidance on the user's testing or QA question.

Query the `quality_spec` dataset using the `spice_sql` tool with hybrid RRF search. Apply testing best practices including the test pyramid, coverage requirements, and quality gates.

Cite specific document paths from the search results. If the quality_spec dataset is under development or returns no results, provide industry-standard QA guidance and recommend updating the spec.
