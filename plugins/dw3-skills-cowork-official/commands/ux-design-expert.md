description: Provide UX design and accessibility guidance
---

Load the ux-design-expert skill and provide guidance on the user's UX design or accessibility question.

Query the `ux_design_spec` dataset using the `spice_sql` tool with hybrid RRF search. Apply WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and the organization's accessibility requirements (mandatory AA compliance, SUS ≥ 80, ADA/Section 508).

Cite specific document paths from the search results. If the query returns no results, provide WCAG 2.1 AA guidance and general UX best practices. Recommend Radix UI + Tailwind for React projects.
